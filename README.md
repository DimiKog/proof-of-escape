# 🏆 Proof of Escape 🗝️

Welcome to the **Proof of Escape** repository! This project is designed to help students learn blockchain concepts through **interactive, on-chain quizzes and rewards**.

---

## 🚀 Overview

**Proof of Escape (PoE)** is a blockchain-based educational game where participants:

- Answer quiz questions 🤔
- Compute cryptographic hashes 🔑
- Submit their answers on-chain 🔗
- Earn **ESCAPE tokens** as proof of completion 🎁

You do **not** need to deploy any smart contracts yourself — the game is pre-deployed on a custon QBFT Education Network based on **Hyperledger Besu**, and ready to use!

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

This game-based activity aims to help students achieve the following learning objectives:

- 🦊 **Create and manage a wallet address** using MetaMask or a similar browser extension.
- 🌐 **Interact with a live blockchain network**, understanding the role of testnets and gas.
- 🧩 **Engage with a Web3 application and faucet**, observing how smart contracts are called via the frontend.
- 🔐 **Get introduced to cryptographic concepts** such as keccak256 hashing and their role in blockchain security.
- 🧠 **Enrich blockchain knowledge** by solving quiz challenges based on real blockchain concepts and block data exploration.

## 🧰 Getting Started

Follow these steps to play the game locally:

### 1. 📦 Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DimiKog/proof-of-escape.git
cd proof-of-escape
```

---

### 2. 🖥️ Launch the Frontend Locally

From the frontend/ folder, start a local web server:

```bash
cd frontend
python3 -m http.server 8000
```
Then visit http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

---

### 3. 🌐 Connect Your Wallet

You can:
- Open MetaMask and **add the custom QBFT Education Network** (details in the guides section [connect metamask](https://github.com/DimiKog/proof-of-escape/blob/main/guides/besu-setup-metamask.md)
- Optionally, get test ESCAPE tokens from the in-app [faucet](https://github.com/DimiKog/proof-of-escape/blob/main/guides/info-for-besu-faucet.md)
- On the page, click **“Connect Wallet”**
- Once connected, click **“Register”** to begin

---

### 4. 📄 Read the Quiz Instructions

- Navigate to the **questions/ folder** in the repository
- Open any quiz file (e.g., quiz1.md)
- Read the instructions carefully to understand where you should search to find the answer and what format it should be in (e.g., keccak256 hash)

---

### 5. 🧪 Try the Hash Tool (Optional)

If the quiz requires a keccak256 hash, you can:
- 🧪 Use the built-in hash tester at the bottom of the homepage
- 💻 Or generate the hash using Remix or any Solidity-based hashing tool

---

### 6. ✅ Submit Your Answer

Use the on-page form to submit your response:
1. Enter the quiz ID and your keccak256 hash of the answer
- Your hash must begin with 0x and be exactly 66 characters long.
- Make sure you’ve followed the quiz instructions to format your input correctly before hashing.
2. The app will:
- Validate the hash format
- Call the smart contract’s checkQuizAnswer(...) function with your hash
3. If your answer is correct:
- ✅ You’ll see a success message
- 🎁 You’ll automatically receive 10 ESCAPE tokens
- 📌 Your completion will be recorded on-chain

⚠️ You can only complete each quiz once per wallet.

---

### 💰 Rewards

Each time you successfully complete a quiz:
- 🎁 You receive 10 ESCAPE tokens minted directly to your wallet
- 👛 You can view your token balance in MetaMask by adding the ESCAPE token address manually

---

### 👛 How to View ESCAPE Tokens in MetaMask

After answering a quiz correctly, you’ll automatically receive 10 ESCAPE tokens to your wallet.

To see your tokens in MetaMask:
1. Open MetaMask and switch to the QBFT Education Network.
2. Click “Import tokens” at the bottom of the Assets tab.
3. Paste the ESCAPE token contract address: 0xb62C4826BfF365827c923a14CCB5137eA0360402
4. Click “Next”, then “Add Custom Token.”

✅ You will now see your ESCAPE balance in MetaMask.

🔎 If you ever forget the token address, you can also find it in contract-info/contract-address.txt.

### 📊 Quiz Completion Tracking

The smart contract tracks how many users have solved each quiz.
Access to these stats will be provided through the front-end (feature under development for now).
