## üîç Question 1 ‚Äì Blockchain Fundamentals

Blockchain technology is the foundation of many decentralized systems. It enables distributed ledgers, secure transactions, and transparent data sharing.

**Question:**  
What is the core technology you are learning in this course?

Your goal is to:
- Identify the correct term.
- Format it properly.
- Hash it using `keccak256` (as used in Solidity).
- Submit the resulting hash to the smart contract.

### üõ†Ô∏è Instructions:

1. Determine the correct term for the core technology used in this course.
2. Use the term in **all lowercase**. No punctuation. No extra characters.
3. Compute the `keccak256` hash of the term (as a UTF-8 string).
4. Submit the resulting hash to the smart contract.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Do NOT include any whitespace or quotes in the string before hashing.
