## üîç Question 2 ‚Äì A Message in the Genesis

The first Bitcoin block ‚Äî known as the *Genesis Block* ‚Äî was mined on January 3rd, 2009. Its creator embedded a message inside the **coinbase transaction input** that referenced a real-world headline related to the financial crisis.

**Question:**  
Inside the coinbase transaction of Bitcoin's Genesis Block, there is a message.  
Find the word used to refer to a political position/title in that message (hint: it's a role, not a name, and not "prime").

Your goal is to:
- Extract the correct word.
- Format it properly.
- Hash it using `keccak256` (as used in Solidity).
- Submit the resulting hash to the smart contract.

### üõ†Ô∏è Instructions:

1. Locate the human-readable message in the coinbase transaction of Block 0.
2. Extract the **word that refers to a political title**.
3. Use the word in **all lowercase**. No punctuation. No extra characters.
4. Compute the `keccak256` hash of the word (as a UTF-8 string).
