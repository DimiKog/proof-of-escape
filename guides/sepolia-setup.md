# ü¶ä Adding Sepolia Network to MetaMask

Before you can get Sepolia ETH, you need to ensure the Sepolia test network is added to your MetaMask wallet. Here's how:

**Method 1: Automatic Addition via a Website (Recommended for Beginners)**

Many Sepolia ETH faucet websites offer a convenient way to add the network automatically.

1. **Visit a Sepolia Faucet:** Go to a reputable Sepolia faucet website (e.g., [Alchemy Sepolia Faucet](https://sepoliafaucet.com/), [Infura Sepolia Faucet](https://faucet.sepolia.infura.io/)).
2. **Connect Your Wallet:** The faucet will likely have a button to "Connect Wallet" or similar. Click it and follow the prompts to connect your MetaMask.
3. **Look for "Add Sepolia Network":** Once connected, the faucet might display a prompt asking if you want to add the Sepolia network to MetaMask. Approve this request within your MetaMask extension.

**Method 2: Manual Addition via MetaMask Settings**

If the automatic method doesn't work or you prefer manual configuration:

1. **Open MetaMask:** Click the MetaMask extension icon in your browser.
2. **Open the Network Menu:** Click the network dropdown menu at the top of the MetaMask window (it likely displays "Ethereum Mainnet" by default).
3. **Click "Add Network":** Scroll down the network list and click the "Add Network" button.
4. **Select "Add a network manually":** On the "Add a network" page, click the "Add a network manually" option.
5. **Enter Sepolia Network Details:** You'll need to fill in the following details:
   - **Network Name:** `Sepolia`
   - **New RPC URL:** `https://rpc.sepolia.org`
   - **Chain ID:** `11155111`
   - **Currency Symbol (Optional):** `SEP`
   - **Block Explorer URL (Optional):** `https://sepolia.etherscan.io`
6. **Save:** After entering all the details, click the "Save" button.

**Verification:**

- Once added, you should see "Sepolia" in your network dropdown menu at the top of your MetaMask.
- You can now switch to the Sepolia network to receive your test ETH.
