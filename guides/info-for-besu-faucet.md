# 💧 Request EDU-D Tokens – Besu EduNet Faucet

To interact with the **Proof of Escape** dApp, you’ll need test tokens on the **QBFT_Besu_EduNet** network.  
These tokens (EDU-D) are used to pay for transaction gas fees.

## 🔗 Faucet Access

Open your browser and visit:

## 📝 How to Request Tokens

1. Make sure you’re connected to the **QBFT_Besu_EduNet** network in MetaMask.
2. Copy your wallet address from MetaMask.
3. Paste it into the faucet form field on the page or use the respective button to connect your wallet.
4. Click **Request Funds**.

You should see a confirmation message. Your wallet will soon receive a small amount of EDU-D.

## ⚠️ Notes

- The faucet has **rate limits**: only 1 request per address per day.
- Do **not** use contract addresses. The faucet only works with externally owned accounts (wallets).
- Make sure MetaMask is unlocked and your wallet is active before submitting.

## 💡 Troubleshooting

- If you don’t see your EDU-D balance, try refreshing MetaMask.
- If the faucet shows an error, wait a few minutes and try again.
- Make sure you’ve added the Besu QBFT EduNet correctly in MetaMask (see [MetaMask Setup Guide](./besu-setup-metamask.md)).
